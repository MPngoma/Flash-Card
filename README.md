# Flash-Card
The goal of this desktop app was to build something useful to my day-to-day life and facilitate learning another language through spaced repetition. This app helps the user to learn the most frequently used words in the French vocabulary.

The Graphical User Interface was made with the Tkinter framework and the Data Visualization was implemented with the Pandas Library.
